## False Positive Suppressions

### Policy/gate files reference algorithm names for detection, not usage
Files matching `*_gate.py`, `*_policies.py`, `**/policy/*.py`:
- References to weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES, RC4) are detection rules, not implementations
- These files define what to scan FOR, they do not use these algorithms

### Test files may intentionally use weak cryptographic material
Files matching `tests/**`, `*_test.py`, `test_*.py`:
- Weak keys, short passwords, and test certificates are intentional fixtures
- Self-signed certificates in test data are expected
- Hardcoded "secret" values in test assertions are test vectors, not credentials

### Crypto audit module references algorithms in documentation
Files matching `crypto_audit.py`, `**/audit/**`:
- References to eval/exec in docstrings describe what the scanner detects
- Algorithm name strings are inventory data, not cryptographic operations

### Scanner output files contain algorithm references as scan results
Files matching `**/reports/**`, `**/output/**`, `*.json` in scan result directories:
- Algorithm names appear as discovered inventory items
- These are scan findings, not code that uses weak algorithms

## Focus Areas
- Prioritize: authentication bypass, injection, insecure deserialization, SSRF
- Flag: new dependencies that haven't been audited
- Flag: changes to permission/authorization logic
- Flag: modifications to cryptographic operations in `backend/app/core/crypto/`
