## Design Principles

### 1. Security by Default

Every cryptographic operation uses secure defaults. Developers cannot accidentally use weak algorithms or configurations.

### 2. Zero Configuration

SDKs embed identity and configuration. No API keys to manage, no secrets to rotate.

### 3. Algorithm Agility

The system can upgrade algorithms without application changes. Key rotation happens transparently.

### 4. Complete Auditability

Every operation is logged with full context: who, what, when, and how.

### 5. Compliance Ready

Built-in support for HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, and FIPS requirements.
